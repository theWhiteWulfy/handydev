# Handydev Tools

The small, neat tools that helps web developers.

## Tools are static in nature and run in your browser

You can always build and host your own copy.

## Development

Use `npm` to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server by running `dev` script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Tools

All tools are located at `pages/`. To add a new tool, just follow the convention of the exsiting tools. The tech stack is TypeScript + React + CSS Modules.

Your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Roadmap

* Add new tools
* Improve existing tools
* Support offline access
* Integrations with  Visual Studio Code
